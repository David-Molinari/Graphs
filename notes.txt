In dft, before hitting end, need to put every room entered on LIFO stack.
At dead end, move to room at top of LIFO stack (remove room from stack), 
and bfs for unsearched direction.
If unsearched direction, dft in that direction.
If no unsearched direction, see line 2.

Where should LIFO stack be kept?
Keep global.

Where should traversal path be kept?
Keep global.

Rooms are logged in self.vertices of graph with exits marked with 
either '?' or the room in the direction.


* The function *

The function receives the player's current room.

check if the visted number of rooms is equal to the # of rooms to explore

if so, break from function

if not,

check if the current room is logged in the graph.verticies:

if not, 
in graph.verticies at the current number, for each exit add a '?' (in a dictionary)
travel in a direction.
log that direction's learnings in graph.verticies
log the direction traveled in the traversal path
push the previous room onto the front of the stack
rerun this function

if so, 
loop through graph.verticies at the current number for an exit with a '?'.
if so, 
see line 28-32.
if not, 
check which of the current exits values matches the number on the top of the stack.
pop it off the stack and travel in the direction.
log the direction traveled in the traversal path.
rerun this function

issue is, when I travel forward, I do not log the learnings for the current room.
